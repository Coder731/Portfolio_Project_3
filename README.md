## TEMPORARY README holders to give links to Headings in the Contents and Main Body (for deletion before submission)
- This section provides holders as scaffolds for quickly building links between Contents and Main Body:
    - Holder to delete (for Contents ("from"/source)):
        - ## [](#link-contents) <a href="link"></a>

    - Holder to delete (for Main Body ("to")):
        - ## [](#link) <a href="link-contents"></a>

## Documentation (Primary Specifications, and Templates used and Project Choice)
### Specifications

#### Assessment Guide
The following Document gives the minimum Specification Necessary for this Website:
- [Assessment Handbook](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+PE_PAGP+2021_Q2/courseware/40cd7850a24d454795ec611831b06b77/980b1952a3a64898ab4010759bd0bd6a/)

##### Outstanding Objectives
-	Implement a given algorithm as a computer program
-	Adapt and combine algorithms to solve a given problem
-	Adequately use standard programming constructs: repetition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists, etc.)
-	Use library software for building a graphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical software
-	Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.
-	Deploy a command-line application to a cloud-based platform

##### Noted Objectives
    - Deploy final version of the Python Essentials application code to a cloud-based platform (github pages deployment) _(NOTE))

### README Template

- [README Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template)

## Necessary Elements
    - PEP8 (End)_
    - functionality works as per the critical project objectives (End)_
    - comments, indent, consistent-meaning-naming-conventions (Process)_

    - Write code that handles empty or invalid input data (During)_
    - Clearly separate and identify code written for the application and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials) (Comments)_
    - consistent flow of logic and data, well defined granular functions (During)_
    - standard programming constructs: repetition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists) (During)
    - standard programming constructs: flow control, iteration, selection, functions, object-oriented programming, data structures - as appropriate (During)_
    - exception/error handling (During)_

    - math software selected
    - external Python libraries where necessary (During)
    - data model / processing
    - code that queries and manipulates data
    - github
    - basic manual testing procedures for code validation (pep8online.com)_
    - deploy command-line application
    - no commented code (Process / End)_
    - deploy to github pages _NOTE
