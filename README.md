LO2	Adapt and combine algorithms to solve a given problem
LO3	Adequately use standard programming constructs: repetition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists, etc.)
LO6	Use library software for building a graphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical software
LO7	Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.
L09	Deploy a command-line application to a cloud-based platform

##### Assessment Guide Minimum Acceptance Criteria

LO1 Implement a given algorithm as a computer program

1.1	Write Python code that passes through a linter (eg PEP8) with no significant issues.
