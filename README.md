## Assessment Guide Minimum Acceptance Criteria

LO1Implement a given algorithm as a computer program

1.1	Write Python code that passes through a linter (eg PEP8) with no significant issues.
1.2	Ensure all intended functionality works as per the critical project objectives
1.3	Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).
LO2 Adapt and combine algorithms to solve a given problem

2.1	Write code that handles empty or invalid input data.
2.2	Clearly separate and identify code written for the application and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials)
2.3	Ensure a consistent flow of logic and data with well defined granular functions
LO3 Adequately use standard programming constructs: repetition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists, etc.)

3.1	Implement standard programming constructs such as flow control, iteration, selection, functions, object-oriented programming and data structures - as appropriate - to achieve the project goals.
3.2	Implement exception/error handling to optimise the user experience
LO4 Explain what a given program does

4.1	Use consistent and effective markdown formatting that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors when writing a README file.
4.2	Write a README.md file in English for the Python application that explains its purpose and the value that it provides to its users.
LO5 Identify and repair coding errors in a program

5.1	Implement basic manual testing procedures for code validation (E.g. pep8online.com)
LO6 Use library software for building a graphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical software

6.1	Implement the use of external Python libraries where appropriate to provide the functionality that the project requires.
LO7 Implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain.

7.1	Implement a working data model that supports the intended project functionality
7.2	Write code that queries and manipulates data to meet the identified vital project needs.
LO8 Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub

8.2	Use Git & GitHub for version control of the web application up to deployment.
LO9 Deploy a command-line application

9.1	Deploy a final version of the Python Essentials application code to a cloud-based platform.
9.2	Ensure that the deployed application is free of commented out code.
